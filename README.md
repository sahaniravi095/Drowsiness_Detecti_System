# Drowsiness Detection System 

* The project aims to detect drowsiness in drivers using computer vision techniques.
* It uses a webcam to capture the driver's face and eyes.
* The face is then detected using the Haar cascade algorithm.
* The eyes are then detected in the ROI (region of interest).
* A deep learning model is used to classify whether the eyes are open or closed.
* If the eyes are closed for a certain period of time, an alarm will be triggered to alert the driver.

The project is implemented in Python using the OpenCV and Keras libraries.

Here are some of the benefits of the Drowsiness Detection System project:

* It can help to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.
* It can improve road safety.
* It can make driving more comfortable and less stressful.
* It can be used in a variety of settings, such as cars, trucks, buses, and trains.

The project is still under development, but it has the potential to make a significant contribution to road safety.

Here are some of the challenges that need to be addressed in order to improve the Drowsiness Detection System project:

* The accuracy of the eye detection algorithm needs to be improved.
* The system needs to be able to detect drowsiness in different lighting conditions.
* The system needs to be able to detect drowsiness in different drivers.
* The system needs to be able to distinguish between drowsiness and other factors that can cause the eyes to close, such as blinking or looking away.

Despite these challenges, the Drowsiness Detection System project is a promising development that has the potential to save lives.
