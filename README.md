The project uses computer vision techniques to detect drowsiness in drivers.
The system first detects the face in the image and then the eyes.
The eyes are then classified as open or closed.
If the eyes are closed for a certain period of time, the system will sound an alarm to alert the driver.
The system can be implemented using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
The project is important because it can help to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. Drowsy driving is a major cause of accidents, and it is estimated that it causes over 100,000 accidents each year in the United States. The Drowsiness Detection System can help to reduce the number of accidents caused by drowsy driving by alerting drivers when they are becoming drowsy.

Here are some of the steps involved in the Drowsiness Detection System project:

Data collection: The first step is to collect data of images of people with open and closed eyes. This data can be collected by taking pictures of people or by downloading it from the internet.
Feature extraction: The next step is to extract features from the images. These features can be the location of the eyes, the shape of the eyes, or the brightness of the eyes.
Model training: The features are then used to train a machine learning model. The model can be a simple decision tree or a more complex deep learning model.
System deployment: The trained model is then deployed in a system that can detect drowsiness in real time. This system can be a webcam or a smartphone app.
The Drowsiness Detection System is a promising project that has the potential to save lives. The project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for preventing accidents caused by drowsy driving.
